##Hello

Here is the setup I will be using for my future JavaScript projects.



##Libraries

[Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)



##Conventions



##Testing

[Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)


##Workflow

Before you start open all documentation you need
Protip: instead of opening the documentation manually everytime, save all in a bookmark folder, that way you can open it all with 1 click. Another tip you can save somedocumentation on a local storage, to open it very fast and offline too. [rambda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/),[jasmine-test](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html),[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript),[HTML, DOM](https://developers.whatwg.org/),[jslint errors](http://jslinterrors.com/)


1. Discuss and Think (what, why, how, todo)
2. Write code
3. Write tests that run against new code written if it makes sense
4. [JSlint](http://new.jslint.com/jslint.html)
5. Check the [checklist](checklist.md)
6. Repeat

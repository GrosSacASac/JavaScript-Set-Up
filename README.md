##Hello

Here is the setup I will be using for my future JavaScript projects. ➳



##Libraries

[Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)



##Conventions

_insert your own rules here_
 
I use 4 space to indent



##Linting and testing

JavaScript linting with [JSLint](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint)

JavaScript tests with [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine). You have to write tests yourself.

HTML tests (Do these 3 html tests only after your html has changed significantly.)

[Basic syntax](http://validator.w3.org/)

[User experience](https://www.modern.ie/en-us)

[Performance](http://yslow.org/)



##Work flow


###Write specifications first

What is your project ? Why ? For who ? How?

How is it going to work ? Business strategy ? Hobby ?


###Before you start

open all documentation you need

Pro tip: instead of opening the documentation manually every time, save all in a bookmark folder, that way you can open it all with 1 click. Another tip you can save somedocumentation on a local storage, to open it very fast and off-line too. 

[rambda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/),
[jasmine-test](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html),
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript),
[HTML and DOM](https://developers.whatwg.org/),
[jslint errors](http://jslinterrors.com/)


###Start

1. Discuss and Think (what, why, how, todo)
2. Edit code
3. Write tests that run against new code written if it makes sense
4. [JSlint](http://new.jslint.com/jslint.html), go to 2 if errors or warning
5. Check the [checklist](checklist.md)
6. Repeat


###End/Production

Optimize, decorate, enhance

In a Web Application, think about minifying files, and offline scenarios

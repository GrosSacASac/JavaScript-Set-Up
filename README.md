##Hello

Here is the set up I will be using for my future JavaScript projects. ➳

You may need [babel](http://babeljs.io/).


##Libraries

[Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)



##Conventions

_insert your own rules here_
 
I use 4 space to indent.

You may use [JSDocs comments](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) to generate documentation especially if you are writing a big API/library.


##Linting and testing

JavaScript linting with [JSLint](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint)

JavaScript tests with [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine). You have to write tests yourself.

HTML tests (Do these 3 html tests only after your html has changed significantly.)

[Basic syntax](http://validator.w3.org/)

[User experience](https://www.modern.ie/en-us)

[Performance](http://yslow.org/)



##Work flow


###When you start a new project

__Write specifications first__

What is your project ? Why ? For who ? How? What does it do, what does it not do ?

How is it going to work ? Business strategy ? Hobby ?

You can win a lot of time here, because changing the specification is easier than changing code. Writing the specification documents will force you to think about use scenarios and edge case before you write code. That saves a lot of code edits.


###Before you start

* Open all documentation you need

Pro tip: instead of opening the documentation manually every time, save all in a bookmark folder, that way you can open it all with 1 click. Another tip you can save some documentation on a local storage, to open it very fast and off-line too. 
([rambda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/),
[jasmine-test](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html),
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects),
[JavaScript+](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/),
[HTML and DOM](https://developers.whatwg.org/),
[jslint errors](http://jslinterrors.com/))

* Chose a good productive text editor

* Configure your keyboard with macros, you should be able to write `function () {}` and `if () {}` with only one key press.

###Cycle

1. Discuss and Think (what, why, how, to do)
2. Edit code
3. Write tests that run against new code written if it makes sense
4. [JSlint](http://new.jslint.com/jslint.html), go to 2 if errors or warning
5. Check the [checklist](checklist.md)
6. Commit your changes
7. Drink water
8. Pause at least 5 minutes (no screen, walk)
9. Repeat


###End/Production

Optimize, decorate, enhance

In a Web Application, think about minifying files, and off-line scenarios
You can include minifying in the cycle if you and your team knows about source maps.

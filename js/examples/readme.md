###Examples

In JavaScript you have a lot of freedom. Possibilities to create classes, singletons, etc ...

Here I will show you different techniques for multiple patterns, I prefer the file with the highest number at the end.

There are people who think a function cannot be a class. An object literal cannot be a singleton. These people are right, in their definitions. What I say is, when I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. Same for functions, when I see a functions that looks like a class and can be used as a class, I call that function a class. You should get the point.

All my example fill the minimal requirements to be called a class or a singleton, etc. A class is something that can produce independent instances with owned data and methods that act toward that data.

###Preferences

* Simple > Complex
* Singleton > Class
* Composition > Inheritance
* Open to extension, closed to change
